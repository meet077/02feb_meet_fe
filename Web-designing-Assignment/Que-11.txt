Q : 11 What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

Ans. 

Block Elements :

	The elements that begin on a new line are known as block elements. A block element takes up the full width of the content. They always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins. It does not contain any other elements next to it.

Inline-Block Elements :

	 Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline. Inline elements don’t start from a new line and don’t have top and bottom margins as block elements have.

* Inline element :
-> Inline elements occupy only sufficient width required.
-> Inline elements don’t start in a new line.
-> Inline elements allow other inline elements to sit behind.
